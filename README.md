## Argochain SDK

The Argochain SDK is a blockchain based on the Polkadot Substrate framework and built securely in Rust. 

## Running a Validator 

Until further down the roadmap you will have to compile the Argochain SDK to build the Argochain Node Client in order to run a validator node and stake your AGC. Binary builds can be found on our [Releases](https://github.com/Devolved-AI/Argochain/releases) page in the releases to come, but these will only suitable for local dApp development and testing scenarios. 

Building and compiling the node is a one-time, but very resource intensive process and we recommend the following hardware specifications:


*Recommended Specifications*\
CPU: 16 cores\
RAM: 32 GB\
Storage: 1TB SSD\
Network: 1 Gpbs Internet Connection

## Development workflow

Pull request

All changes (except new releases) are handled through pull requests.

Versioning

Frontier follows Semantic Versioning. An unreleased crate in the repository will have the -dev suffix in the end, and we do rolling releases.

When you make a pull request against this repository, please also update the affected crates' versions, using the following rules. Note that the rules should be applied recursively -- if a change modifies any upper crate's dependency (even just the Cargo.toml file), then the upper crate will also need to apply those rules.

Additionally, if your change is notable, then you should also modify the corresponding CHANGELOG.md file, in the "Unreleased" section.

If the affected crate already has -dev suffix:

If your change is a patch, then you do not have to update any versions.
If your change introduces a new feature, please check if the local version already had its minor version bumped, if not, bump it.
If your change modifies the current interface, please check if the local version already had its major version bumped, if not, bump it.
If the affected crate does not yet have -dev suffix:

If your change is a patch, then bump the patch version, and add -dev suffix.
If your change introduces a new feature, then bump the minor version, and add -dev suffix.
If your change modifies the current interface, then bump the major version, and add -dev suffix.
If your pull request introduces a new crate, please set its version to 1.0.0-dev.
